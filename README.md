Haskell bindings to the Google Maps Geocoding API

This respository has no connection with Google Inc. of its affiliates.

The [Google Maps Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro) provides a direct way
to access geocoding and reverse geocoding services via an HTTP request. This library provides bindings in Haskell to that API.

NB: The use of the Google Maps Geocoding API services is subject to the [Google Maps APIs Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/maps/terms), which terms restrict the use of content
(eg no use without a Google map). In the light of the 'End User Terms and Privacy Policy' clauses of those terms, by using the library
in this repository you are agreeing to be bound by Google's Terms of Service.
